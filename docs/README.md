# Challenge

For the [NOI Hachathon SFScon edition 2021](https://www.hackathon.bz.it/), [Ontopic](https://ontopic.ai) invites you to develop a proof-of-concept or mockup for an app which provides as rich contextual information as reasonable about the current geographical position, by using data from the [South-Tyrolean Open Data Hub (ODH)](https://opendatahub.bz.it/) Virtual Knowledge Graph, the ODH Web API and external data sources, such as Wikidata, DBpedia or others.

## Price criteria

* The preferred data source is the ODH VKG, so that data can be queried as precisely as possible.
* Data should be presented in an appealing and clear manner.


## How to proceed

In the website, we provide you some suggestions on how to:

  - Query the WebAPI by consulting the [documentation](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
  - Query the [VKG](vkg) using some pre-defined SPARQL queries and by looking at its schema.
  - Set up the environment on your machine as an alternative to running the queries on the [ODH endpoint](https://sparql.opendatahub.testingmachine.eu/portal/)
  - Query [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) with the help of some examples

## Mentorship

Erdal Domi will be your mentor of this edition.
