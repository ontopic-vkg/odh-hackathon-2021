# ODH API

For the data that you cannot get through querying the ODH VKG, you should fall back to the API. It contains all the available data and can be interrogated as a regular API data point. You can become more familiar with what is available through the various documentation pages and the [data browser](https://databrowser.opendatahub.bz.it/).

## Documentation

The documentation can be found [here](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and contains instructions on what is available, how to access the data, apps built with the ODH datasets, etc.

For information on a particular dataset, you can refer to the `Datasets` section of the documentation. For example, for the accommodation datasets the API reference would be found [here](https://tourism.api.opendatahub.bz.it/swagger/index.html#/Accommodation).
