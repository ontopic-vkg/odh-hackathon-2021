# Challenge details

## General concept

We are challenging you to better understand the efficacy and extent to which you can combine the data from [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.bz.it/) with user contextual data: what the user is doing in the real world. We offer the GPS location as the main context, however it does not have to be limited to that. One approach could be to have the user give a few pieces of information about an upcoming activity or a destination in order to get more context. For example, the application could ask the user where they intend to go, if they are familiar with the location, if they are looking for an active or passive experience, and so on. Part of the challenge is how to get this contextual information from the user without it being an exhaustive questionaire-style interrogation.

This information is then used to optimize the queries and the data that you will be retrieving from the different data sources. With more context you can deliver more tailored and specific content, however, more specific is not always better. A combination of general and specific information delivery could be a viable approach. Time of day, weather, location and other inputs could help you decide what information would be most likely to inform and support the user in their activity.

You may decide what kind of delivery is best for your application: push notification style or in-app, it is up to you to evaluate.

## Example results/outputs

Here is a non-exhaustive list of some pieces of information the user can be delivered throughout their activity or day, that is intended to build your intuition about your approach. You may analyse the viability of these items based on the user context and available data. They are intended to give you a general range of the information that can be shown to the user.

* User is delivered a photo from the nearest webcam to the user destination, in order to gauge weather conditions.
* User is given some information about temperature from sensors in the destination, both current and forecasted temperature.
* User is given some information about a municipality they just entered. 
* If user has chosen a restaurant as their destination, give a random recipe from the restaurant menu to the user.
* User is given events around their destination, ranging a few days, in case they would like to visit again.
* When user is close to their destination, user is given information about a random point of interest near to them.
* User is prompted that there are rentable bikes nearby.
* User is reminded of the sunset time.
